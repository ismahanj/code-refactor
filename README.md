I named the website "horiseon" 
I thought the tope section was the head so i assigned it 
in the body I had the first section be the navbar becasue it helps the reader navigate the site. I divided the next two section to be an article and section but they are not displayed side by side like I wanted. the last such i denoted as the footer.
